Project Title:
  Machine Learning Portfolio: Algorithms and Datasets
Project Description:
Our project, the Comprehensive Machine Learning Algorithms and Models, is a collection of 12 sub-projects that cover a wide range of machine learning techniques and applications. With a focus on practical implementation, our repository provides a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field.

The sub-projects included in our repository are:

Linear Regression: Trained on an ecommerce customer dataset from Kaggle, this project aims to predict customer spending patterns and provide insights for marketing strategies.

Logistic Regression: Utilizing an advertising dataset from Kaggle, this project focuses on predicting the likelihood of customer response to advertising campaigns.

Decision Tree: Implemented using loan data from Wikipedia, this project offers a predictive model to determine loan approval or rejection based on various factors.

Random Forest: Developed with the purpose of diagnosing the Kyphosis disease, this project employs a dataset specifically curated for the detection and prediction of this medical condition.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Leveraging the well-known Iris flower dataset, our SVM project provides a classification model to accurately categorize iris flower species.

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): With a project dataset specifically designed for KNN, this implementation offers a versatile and intuitive classification algorithm.

K-Means Clustering: Utilizing college-related data, our K-Means Clustering project provides a means to group similar colleges based on various attributes and characteristics.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Trained on a dataset of clothing reviews, our RNN project offers sentiment analysis and opinion mining capabilities for understanding customer feedback.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition, utilizing a dataset specifically designed for training and evaluating the performance of CNNs.

Word2Vec: Using the Gutenberg text of "Alice in Wonderland," our Word2Vec project aims to capture semantic word relationships and vector representations through the power of word embeddings.

BERT Model: Trained on movie review data from IMDb, our BERT model project offers sentiment analysis and text classification capabilities, showcasing the power of pre-trained transformer models.

Each sub-project is accompanied by detailed documentation, including implementation details, data preprocessing steps, and usage guidelines. Additionally, the repositories contain the necessary datasets or instructions on how to obtain them.
