Project Title:
  Machine Learning Portfolio: Algorithms and Datasets
  
Project Description:
Our project, the Comprehensive Machine Learning Algorithms and Models, is a collection of 12 sub-projects that cover a wide range of machine learning techniques and applications. With a focus on practical implementation, our repository provides a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field.

The sub-projects included in our repository are:

[Linear Regression](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/Linear%20Regression)
: Trained on an ecommerce customer dataset from Kaggle, this project aims to predict customer spending patterns and provide insights for marketing strategies.

[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/Logistic%20Regression): Utilizing an advertising dataset from Kaggle, this project focuses on predicting the likelihood of customer response to advertising campaigns.

[Decision Tree](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/Decision%20Tree): Implemented using loan data from Wikipedia, this project offers a predictive model to determine loan approval or rejection based on various factors.

[Random Forest](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/Random%20Forest): Developed with the purpose of diagnosing the Kyphosis disease, this project employs a dataset specifically curated for the detection and prediction of this medical condition.

[Support Vector Machines (SVM)](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/Support%20Vector%20Machines): Leveraging the well-known Iris flower dataset, our SVM project provides a classification model to accurately categorize iris flower species.

[k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/K-Nearest-Neighbours): With a project dataset specifically designed for KNN, this implementation offers a versatile and intuitive classification algorithm.

[K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/k-means-clustering): Utilizing college-related data, our K-Means Clustering project provides a means to group similar colleges based on various attributes and characteristics.

[Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/RNN): Trained on a dataset of clothing reviews, our RNN project offers sentiment analysis and opinion mining capabilities for understanding customer feedback.

[Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/CNN): This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition, utilizing a dataset specifically designed for training and evaluating the performance of CNNs.

[Word2Vec](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/Word%20Embeddings): Using the Gutenberg text of "Alice in Wonderland," our Word2Vec project aims to capture semantic word relationships and vector representations through the power of word embeddings.

[BERT Model](https://github.com/AdrijaDhar/Machine-Learning-Portfolio-Algorithms-and-Datasets/tree/master/BERT_IMDB%20MOvie%20review): Trained on movie review data from IMDb, our BERT model project offers sentiment analysis and text classification capabilities, showcasing the power of pre-trained transformer models.
